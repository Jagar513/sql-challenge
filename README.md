# Key Relationships

titles and employees tables: (1:N)

departments and dept_manager tables: (1:N)

employees and dept_manager tables: (1:N)

employees and dept_emp tables: (M:N)

departments and dept_emp tables: (M:N)

employees and salaries tables: (1:1)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2: Data Engineering

Tables created and placed in Data_Engineering.sql

I stored the birth_date and hire_date as VARCHAR(10) instead of DATE.
I was having trouble with importing the employees CSV into PostgreSQL databases.
I tried to execute a command to change the date from YYYY-MM-DD to MM-DD-YYYY but I kept getting an error.
I understand using DATE is the correct Data Type but after struggling with the error I ended up using VARCHAR.
